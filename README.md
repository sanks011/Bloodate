You will need XAMPP to run this server locally.
run XAMPP and turn on MYSQL  and Apache 


after downloading this donatetheblood folder
extract it
cut this folder to xampp>>htdocs>> then paste it there

now if you have turned on XAMPP , you can go to any browser and type    localhost/donatetheblood



after that first time you will probably see an error saying didnt connect to donor_db


so,


now on browser type localhost/phpmyadmin


after opening create an database named blood_db
then inside that bl0od_db   just click on insert and insert/import the provided doner_db file and it will import all the required column.. 


******if it doesnt work you need to create a table with 12 column in blood_db named donor_db...

12 columns would be -   ID(set it AI ) (int) limit try to give 10,//        NOW FROM GIVE LIMIT MORE THAN 80,  now all (VARCHAR)---  NAME, CONTACT, DOB, HOS_NO, CITY, BLOOD_GROUP, GENDER, PASSWORD, EMAIL, SAVE_LIFE_DATE, REDIRECT_URL*********


NOW IT SHOULD WORK!
